% More Plain-Text GTD

About a year ago I adopted a [plain-text system for getting things
done][], using Notational Velocity, Simplenote, and the "q" key as a
substitute for bigger GTD programs like Things or OmniFocus. I'm still
happily using the same system today and have developed a few additional
"hacks" to make it work for me.

The only major addition I've made to the basic system is that I now
often assign tasks priority simply by putting `qqq` in the title of my
note attached to that task, instead of the usual `qq`. This is really
just a further borrowing from Merlin Mann's "q" trick, which I explained
in my [original post][]. But at that time, I was still adding hashtags
like `@tw` or `@td` to tasks that I wanted to accomplish this week or
today. Now I just use three q's so when I want a more focused list of
high-priority items, I just search for `qqq` in NV instead of `qq`, which
pulls up all of my tasks.

The other thing that has changed in the last year is that I have become
even more of a plain-text nerd than I already was. I still find
[Notational Velocity][] to be the easiest way to enter new tasks and
find old ones, but I also now use Vim, Mutt, and other command-line Unix
programs as a regular part of my workflow. And I've learned much more
about baked-in Unix goodies like `grep`, `sort`, and `awk`. All of this
has allowed me to extend my plain-text GTD system while learning some
bash scripting along the way.

In fact, keeping all of my tasks in plain text files has advantages now
that I didn't anticipate at the time because I can so easily manipulate
my system to add features. For example, let's say I wanted to print off
a list of all my tasks for this week. I could simply switch to the
directory where I keep all of my task files and run

    ls | grep qqq | lpr

to print a to-do list from my default printer. That same basic
`ls | grep` pipe enables me to call up tasks at any time from the
Terminal, too, and do various things. I can also leverage the power of
piping in Unix to make new tasks. If I have a text file that requires
some action on my part, or some text in `stdin` that I want put in a
task note, I can do something like this:

    cat foo.txt > notes/"qq Take care of the foo".txt

In my earlier post, I mentioned that it was easy to get text into
Notational Velocity using a Mac OS X service that takes selected text in
any application and pastes it into a new note. That's possible and
probably even faster from the command line, too; if I've copied
something to my system clipboard, I can invoke [DTerm][] and type
`pbpaste > notes/"qq Read over this text".txt`. In short, as I've gained
more facility with the command line, I've discovered even more ways to
quickly create and work with my `qq` files.

Shell scripting extends the system even further. For example, in my
first post I noted that one of the things I had not figured out yet was
how to schedule tasks or alert myself automatically when a due date was
nearing. Now it's possible to imagine how a `cron` job could do that for
me, though I haven't tried it. What I have done is written a simple
script that searches through my `qq` files, finds tasks that are due in
the next two weeks, and then prints a reminder to my terminal every time
I start a new shell session that looks like this:

    -1 days  Change smoke alarm batteries due(05-13-12)
    7 days   Change A/C Filter every three months @home due(05-22-12)

Here's the [gist of that script][], but less important than the
specifics is the basic principle: keeping tasks in plain text files,
rather than in a proprietary database, makes it possible to easily
manipulate them--for free--in whatever way makes sense to you.
[Todo.txt][] is perhaps the most elaborate example of this, but the
basic idea applies to my system, too. Nor is shell scripting the only
possible way of doing things like printing a "due soon" reminder. In
another post that I wrote before really getting into bash, I explained
[how to use Applescript to make a new task][], and others may be able to
write more elegant Python, Ruby, or Awk scripts to accomplish similar
things. That sort of flexibility--and the fact that I only have to see
those features that *I* need--is what I still like about my GTD system
today.
