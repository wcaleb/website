This post was originally published on my old blog as [Applescript and Notational Velocity](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=175 "Permanent Link: Applescript and Notational Velocity"). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an earlier post, I explained [how I use plain text files and
Notational Velocity as a task-management
alternative](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=153) to the GTD program
[Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/). Towards the end of that post,
I also hinted that I have been able to automate parts of my system by
using some Applescript and Automator tricks. Most of these tricks depend
on using an apparently little-known feature of Notational Velocity,
which is the ability to perform the “search” command on your notes using
Applescript.

As [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) users know, what makes
the program unique is the fact that most of its functions begin in the
“search” bar. If you want to create a note, you go to the search bar,
begin typing the title of your new note, and click enter to create it.
If you want to open an existing note, you also go to the search bar and
begin entering the text that you want to find.

With the release of [Version
2.0β4](http://notational.net/releasenotes/release2/) at the beginning of
2011, however, it became possible to “search” for text strings in NV
using Applescript. (If you are new to Applescript, check out [the
Ultimate Beginner’s
Guide](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/applescript/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-applescript/).)
This makes it relatively simple to write an Applescript that will create
a new note in Notational Velocity, like this:

        tell application "Notational Velocity"
            activate
            search "Name of the new note"
            tell application "System Events"
                keystroke return
                key code 53
                set visible of process "Notational Velocity" to false
            end tell
        end tell

The first part of this Applescript tells Notational Velocity to search
for whatever text is between the quotation marks after `search` (in this
case, `Name of the new note`). The second part of the script uses System
Events to simulate the process of hitting return, which you would
ordinarily do in Notational Velocity to create your new note after
entering its title in the search bar. It also adds `key code 53` (which
has the same effect as entering the Escape key) so that the query is
cleared from the search bar after the new note is created. Finally,
since the first part of the script activated Notational Velocity,
thereby bringing it to the foreground, the script concludes by hiding
the NV window from view so you can go back to whatever you were doing.

With some slight modifications, you can also use a script like this to
enter some text into the body of the new note you create, but more on
that in a moment. First, if you are familiar with NV and are following
along so far, you’ll probably realize that this script has some
important limitations. Namely, if the text string that you’re searching
for is already in a note in your NV database, you’ll run into some
problems because instead of creating a new note, NV will find the note
with that text.

Nonetheless, this script has been useful in helping me to automate parts
of my previously-described GTD system. Here’s an example: in a previous
post, I explained [how and why I use my iPad to grade student
papers](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=113). I also use my iPad to
annotate other documents that need feedback from me. So when I receive a
paper to grade or a document to annotate, there are two things I need to
do: (a) get the file to my iPad for annotation; (b) add a “to do” (or a
`qq`, using [the syntax I explained
before](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/?p=153)) to Notational Velocity
so I’ll remember that I need to read the file. To accomplish both of
these tasks at once, I use an Automator workflow that incorporates a
beefed-up version of the simple script above.

Before showing you the workflow, however, I should also explain why I
now prefer to use
[GoodReader](http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html), rather than
[iAnnotate](http://www.ajidev.com/iannotate/), for most of the
annotation that I do on my iPad.

### GoodReader versus iAnnotate

When I wrote my earlier post on grading with my iPad, I was using
[iAnnotate](http://www.ajidev.com/iannotate/), and sometimes I still do.
But I’ve switched to
[GoodReader](http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html) for annotating
most PDFs, in large part because the process of syncing files to my iPad
is easier and more intuitive. Since I wrote my earlier post, GoodReader
has also added a full slate of annotation tools that compares nicely
with iAnnotate and even adds some features that work better, in my view.

I learned about GoodReader’s killer syncing capabilities from [this
episode of Mac Power
Users](http://macpowerusers.com/2011/04/mpu-048-goodreader/), which also
discusses lots of other features peculiar to GoodReader. The most
important payoff is this: GoodReader allows me to [keep particular
folders in my Dropbox automatically
synchronized](http://www.goodiware.com/gr-man-tr-servers.html#sync)
between my iPad and my desktop. For example, I have a folder in my
[Dropbox](http://db.tt/SXfRhdY) called “annotate.” I have set up
GoodReader so that this folder is synchronized on my iPad. So whenever I
add a file on my laptop to the “annotate” folder, I can get this file on
my iPad just by tapping the “Sync” button in GoodReader. Then, when I
annotate the file on my iPad, I just tap “Sync” again, and the marked-up
file will appear in my Dropbox and on my laptop. Nifty, no?

### An example workflow

Now that I’m using GoodReader, Step A of the workflow I described above
(getting the file to my iPad) basically means moving the file into my
“annotate” folder so that it can be synchronized to GoodReader later.
The next step in my workflow is then to add a `qq` note in Notational
Velocity that tells me to read the file. To do both, I use Automator.
(If you’re new to Automator, here’s [an
introduction](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/applescript/automator-the-ultimate-automation-assistant/).)

To see what my Automator workflow looks like, click on the image below

[![image](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/files/2011/10/ToAnnotate-300x291.jpg "ToAnnotate")](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/files/2011/10/ToAnnotate.jpg)

The first step in this workflow moves the file in question to my
annotate folder, so that it’s ready to be accessed on my iPad via
Dropbox synchronization. The workflow then passes the name of the file I
need to annotate to an Applescript, which creates a note in Notational
Velocity that says `qq Read examplefile.pdf`. (This Applescript is
longer than the one I showed you above, because I don’t want the title
of my to-do to include the whole pathname of the file. In this example,
I also then have the Applescript put the pathname in the body of the new
note, before simulating the Escape key and hiding Notational Velocity
from view.)

Sometimes the file I need to annotate comes to me as a Microsoft Word
document, in which case I also need to turn the file into a PDF. So I
have a separate Automator workflow with an extra step at the beginning
that turns Word documents into PDF files. Click the image below to see
what I mean.

[![image](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/files/2011/10/ToAnnotateWord-300x191.jpg "ToAnnotateWord")](http://mcdaniel.blogs.rice.edu/files/2011/10/ToAnnotateWord.jpg)

To make a (potentially even longer) story short, I have saved these
Automator workflows as plug-ins for Finder. (I am still using Mac OS
10.5.8, and Automator underwent some significant changes in Snow
Leopard, including the elimination of “plug-ins” in favor of [something
similar called
Services](http://gigaom.com/apple/quick-tip-automator-and-services-in-snow-leopard/))
So when I have a file in my Finder that I want to annotate in
GoodReader, I basically right-click on the file, navigate to my “To
Annotate” workflow, click on it, and voila: the file is moved to my
annotate folder, and a new task is created reminding me to read the
file. I’ll see that task next time I do my GTD review.

That’s just one example of the kinds of automation I can add into my
plain-text GTD system, and it’s certainly the one I use the most. But
since [you can schedule Applescripts to run on particular dates in
iCal](http://www.tuaw.com/2008/04/14/mac-101-schedule-your-scripts/),
it’s also easy to imagine how you could use a simple Notational Velocity
Applescript and iCal to simulate the process of automatically creating
scheduled or repeating tasks in
[Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/). But that is a post for
another day.

**UPDATE:** I’ve since figured out how to do this particular workflow
much more efficiently using a shell script and the command line. Still,
the Applescript functionality of NV might be useful for other workflows.
