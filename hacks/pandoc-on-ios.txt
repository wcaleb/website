% Using Pandoc on iOS (Sorta)
% W. Caleb McDaniel

As I've explained before, I now do almost all of my writing---[including
my academic writing][]---in plain-text, Markdown files. I then use the
incomparable document-conversion tool, [Pandoc][], to turn these files
into HTML, Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, or EPUBs. Even [this
website][] is produced with Pandoc.

One virtue of this preference for plain-text files is that it enables me
to write on my iOS devices. Plain text is mobile. But Pandoc is not, or
so I have long assumed. Because Pandoc is a command-line utility, my
ability to convert Markdown into Pandoc's other file formats has so far
been tethered to my laptop.[^1]

Enter [Docverter][], an open-source tool that makes it possible to use
Pandoc without having it installed on your machine. To use it, you post
`multipart/form-data` requests to a URL and get Pandoc output as a
response, using the [Docverter API][] to select which Pandoc options you
want to use. So, for example, you can send Markdown text to Docverter
and get back formatted PDF output, which you can then write to a PDF
file---all without having a computer with Pandoc installed.

But can you use Docverter without having a desktop or laptop computer at
all? At first glance, no: the documentation suggests using another
command-line Unix utility, `curl`, to make requests to Docverter. But
you can't use `curl` from an iPhone or an iPad, or at least not easily.
If you want to use Pandoc from an iOS device, you need a different way
to access Docverter.

Pythonista + Docverter = iPandoc (Sorta)
----------------------------------------

The solution is [Pythonista][], an inexpensive iOS app that allows you
to write and execute Python scripts, including ones that interact with
web services like---you guessed it---Docverter. Last weekend I spent a
day writing a script that uses `httplib`, one of the standard Python
libraries included with Pythonista, to post requests to Docverter from
my iPad and get back Pandoc output.

You can [grab the script][], with explanatory comments, as a Gist.

Briefly put, the script works like this. I open a text editing app like
Nebulous Notes and put some Markdown text on my iOS clipboard. I open
Pythonista and run my iMDtoPDF script. A few moments later, a PDF output
file appears in my [Dropbox][].[^2]

This method will help me quite a bit in the following sort of situation:
I am away from my laptop, but I need to email a long, footnote-heavy
document to someone. Or a student requests a recommendation letter that
is due before I can get to my computer, and I need to create a PDF
version with letterhead from the plain text version of the letter that I
keep under version control. Now I can run this script, go to my iOS
Dropbox app, and email the PDF file from there, all without leaving the
iPad.

In other words, I can use Pandoc on the iPad ... sorta. I haven't yet
figured out how to utilize all of Docverter's options in my script. And
unlike Pandoc, Docverter does not use LaTeX to produce PDFs. Instead, it
converts Markdown to HTML and then uses a service called [Flying
Saucer][] to print that HTML to a PDF. Nonetheless, this method still
allows you to control some of the styling of the PDF by using a CSS
stylesheet and embedded fonts. For example, [here's the PDF output][] of
this post using the CSS declarations included in my script.[^3]

Extending the Script
--------------------

In [the Gist version][grab the script] of this script, I've deliberately
kept things simple. But the version I'm using has several extended
features.

For example, the public version automatically gives the output PDF file
a generic, time-stamped name. But you can use Pythonista's console
module to prompt yourself for a specific title.

~~~~ {.python}
## Name output file with user input
import console
title = console.input_alert('Output filename', 'Enter title below')
outfile = title + '.pdf'
~~~~

By adding these two lines to the end, I can also have the script
automatically open the output file in [GoodReader][], where I can then
preview, annotate or email it:

~~~~ {.python}
## Get temporary URL for file in Dropbox
share_url = dropbox_client.media(outfile)
url = share_url.get('url', 'not found')

## Prefix the URL with 'g' to open in Goodreader
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open('g' + url)
~~~~

Python makes numerous other features possible: my modified version, for
example, prints a timestamp in the footer of the PDF's first page. And
Docverter itself can be used to extend the script: with a slight tweak
of the script's `fields` variable, for instance, you can output Docx
files or EPUB files instead. Finally, by stringing together Pythonista
with other apps like Drafts, it's possible to automate this script
without having to manually launch Pythonista every time a conversion
takes place.[^4]

These solutions, to be sure, do not bring Pandoc in all its glory to the
iOS platform. But they do *sorta* make Pandoc mobile. And I think that's
sorta cool.

[^1]: I should note that many iOS text editors now feature the ability
    to create Markdown previews or convert Markdown into HTML. But they
    lack some of the features of Pandoc that I most rely on, like
    footnotes and PDF output.

[^2]: The ability to upload the file to Dropbox requires taking two
    other steps in addition to this script. First, you have to create a
    free Dropbox development app. Then, you have to create [this
    separate script][] in Pythonista; it includes a function for
    interacting with the Dropbox API that is called by my script. For
    more information, see [Using the Dropbox module][] in the Pythonista
    forums.

[^3]: Flying Saucer's method of producing PDFs does have disadvantages
    over Pandoc's native use of LaTeX; for example, you'll notice in the
    PDF version of this post that quotation marks within code blocks are
    converted into HTML character codes, which wouldn't happen if I had
    made the PDF using Pandoc on my laptop. For most of the mobile use
    cases that I can imagine, however, Flying Saucer should fine.
