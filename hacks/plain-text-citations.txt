% Plain Text Note and Citation Management
% W. Caleb McDaniel
% May 5, 2014

When I started the research for my second book project, I decided to
rethink my writing and note-taking process from the ground up. After
[switching to a plain-text writing workflow][] in the middle of writing
my first academic book, I knew that I wanted to write and take notes
exclusively in Markdown for this new project. I knew that I wanted to
experiment with open notebook research by hosting all of my notes in an
[online, version-controlled wiki][]. And I also wanted to be able to
store, locate, and easily cite bibliographic information for secondary
sources used in my research.

In this post, which serves as a sort of technical companion to my post
on [Open Notebook History][], I will explain how I am managing my notes
and citations using plain text files, [Gitit][], and [Pandoc][]---John
MacFarlane's amazing open-source program for document conversion.

Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff have recently written for the Programming
Historian about [how to write scholarship in Plain Text using Markdown
and Pandoc][], and my basic workflow is very similar to the one they
describe, with one major difference. As Tenen and Wythoff explain,
Pandoc allows you to [use a BibTex database to insert citations][] into
a Markdown document.[^1] Instead of maintaining *one* `*.bib` file,
however, my system stores BibTeX data and free-form notes for each
secondary source in its own, separate file.

In other words, my method for managing citations is similar to my
[plain-text GTD system][]. In my GTD system, every task gets its own
text file. Similarly, in my research notebook, every secondary
source---whether it is a book, an article, a book chapter, or a
dissertation---gets *its* own text file.

This method allows me to give every secondary source its own page in my
[Gitit wiki][online, version-controlled wiki], so that I can link to
specific sources within wiki pages. When I am ready to process a
Markdown file that has citation keys, I combine all of my BibTeX entries
into a single bibliography file, at which point my process begins to
look again like the one Tenen and Wythoff describe.

Before diving into the details of how and why I manage citations this
way, it may help to view this screencast that shows what my note-taking
and citation workflow looks like in real time:

<iframe width="540" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kjJc8IdH9FQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1"></iframe>

* * * * *

As that screencast describes, for every new book, article, or
dissertation I encounter, I create a new plain text file that becomes a
page in my wiki. At the top of the file, I include bibliographic
information about the source using the [BibTeX][] reference management
software, and I wrap the citation block inside Pandoc's code block
syntax, so that it looks like this:

    ~~~~~{.bib}
    @Book{ kerby1972,
        author = {Robert L. Kerby},
        title = {Kirby Smith's Confederacy: The Trans-{M}ississippi South, 1863--1865},
        address = {New York},
        publisher = {Columbia University Press},
        year = 1972,
    }
    ~~~~~

I then take notes about the source directly in that same text file,
whose filename is the same as the BibTeX key.[^2] You can see what this
looks like in the screencast, or [take a look at an example here][].

## Citing sources in Markdown

Pandoc allows you to insert citations using BibTeX keys like `kerby1972`
in the above example. I'm using Pandoc version 1.12.1 in the screencast,
and it's worth noting that some new features have been implemented in
the latest version. But the [basic method for inserting citations][]
still holds.[^3]

In order to convert the citations in a Markdown file into fully
formatted footnotes, Pandoc needs both a bibliography file containing
all the cited BibTeX entries and a CSL file to tell it which style
manual to use.

The CSL file I use for most projects is [available in this Gist][]; it's
basically the standard [chicago-fullnote-bibliography-no-ibid][] CSL
file, with the exception of the change [described here][]. That file
goes in my `$HOME/.csl` folder so that Pandoc can find it later.

To create the bibliography file that Pandoc needs when processing my
Markdown manuscript file, I use a [Python Pandoc filter and a shell
script][] to get the BibTeX entries out of each of my note files, add a
"short title" in the "note" field, and append the entry to a single
bibliography file.[^4]

Once I have generated the bibliography file, converting my Markdown
manuscript means running a command that usually looks something like
this:

    pandoc --bibliography=gitit.bib --csl=chicago.csl --output=manuscript.pdf manuscript.txt

Watch the screencast to see what an example output PDF looks like once
Pandoc has processed all the citations. Changing the output filename to
a `*.docx` file makes it possible to create a Microsoft Word file, too.

## Gitit customizations

As mentioned above, I go through the extra trouble of keeping my BibTeX
entries in separate files so that each secondary source can get its own
page in [my wiki][online, version-controlled wiki]. All of my notes are
kept in a Git repository, and when I push new commits to the repo, my
online wiki is updated so that changes are reflected there.

I have also written a [Haskell plugin][] that uses [Bibtex2Html][] to
convert the bibliographic block at the top of each page into a formatted
citation whenever the page is loaded by a user.[^5] Though this is not
an essential part of the workflow, it makes the pages on the wiki a bit
more readable and means that a formatted citation for each of my
secondary sources is always handy if I need it.

## Vim customizations

My citation management system is text editor independent. But I have
created some shortcuts that make it easier for me to manage my notes in
Vim.

For example, whenever I push a commit to my notes' Git repository, a
post-commit hook generates a Vim dictionary file that contains all of
the BibTeX keys in my Wiki:

    basename -s .page -a /Users/wcm1/Dropbox/wikidata/*.page | grep '^[a-z]\+[0-9]\{4\}$' > /Users/wcm1/.vim/dicts/bibtexpages.txt

This hook relies on the fact that the filenames for each of my secondary
source notes is the same as the BibTeX keys. So getting a list of all of
my BibTeX keys just means listing all of the files in the directory and
finding filenames that start with a string and end with a four-digit
number.[^6] Piping that list to a dictionary file means that I can
[autocomplete BibTeX citations in Vim][], as demonstrated in the
screencast.

I also have a [Vim command that allows me to create a new page in my
Wiki][] just by typing the following at the command line:

    :Wiki lichtenstein1996

where `lichtenstein1996` is the name of the new Wiki page. Because of
the way this command works, if I already have a page by that name in my
wiki, Vim will just open that page. This prevents me from overwriting
existing files or creating duplicate BibTeX keys, which would be more of
a problem if I were keeping all of my entries in a single `*.bib` file.

To open already existing notes more easily, I use the [FuzzyFinder][]
plugin, together with a [mapping that binds a shortcut][] to my
`wikidata` directory.

My system also would not be sustainable if I had to remember proper
BibTeX syntax every time I wanted to create a new citation. Fortunately,
the [snipMate][] plug-in for Vim allows me to create
snippets---often-typed blocks of text that can be inserted into a Vim
buffer just be typing a special trigger word and hitting `<Tab>`. I have
written [pre-defined snippets][] that insert BibTeX templates directly
into my file and allow me to fill in each field by tabbing through the
template, as demonstrated in the screencast.

These snippets also fill out some of the fields for me based on the name
of the file. Since I name each file containing a source according to the
BibTeX key I want to use, the snippet uses that filename to fill in the
BibTeX key and determine the year of publication.[^7]

## Conclusion

Although this system took some thinking and tweaking to set up, using it
has now become second nature, and I seldom have to touch the underlying
scripts that hold it together. But I also like that the system could be
easily adapted if I later decided that I wanted to use a program like
[Zotero][] or [BibDesk][] to manage my citations. Since I will have kept
my entries in BibTeX from the beginning, any citation software that
interfaces with `*.bib` files (which is most of the ones currently on
the market) will be able to accept my notes in the future. At the same
time, I am not locked into any proprietary database file formats.[^8]

That's the beauty of plain text files that (ostensibly) justifies the
lengths to which I've gone to make this system work. And whatever its
quirks, it is a system that does exactly what I need it to do because,
unlike larger bibliographic management programs written to suit every
imaginable discipline and use case, it was designed specifically and
exclusively for my needs. So far, so good!

    files maintained by [Jason Heppler][] and [Lincoln Mullen][].
    [Kieran Healy][] also uses Pandoc and BibTex to publish sociology
    papers, and his write-up also details how to integrate statistics
    and figures into the workflow using R.

[^2]: My method of mixing notes and BibTeX is similar to the one
    described by [John Lenz][] in a four-part series of blog posts,
    though my implementation is not quite the same as his.

[^3]: Note that the screencast does not explain how I keep notes on
    primary sources, which is a subject for another day.

[^4]: For more on Pandoc filters, check out John MacFarlane's tutorial
    on [scripting with Pandoc][].

[^5]: I got the idea for doing this from the aforementioned [John
    Lenz][1] posts, but my own plugin is basically just a modified
    version of the [Dot.hs][] plugin distributed with the Gitit source
    code.

[^6]: If I were keeping all of my BibTeX entries in a single file and
    trying to extract a list of keys from it, I would probably use
    Lincoln Mullen's [bibkeys][] Gem.

[^7]: If I were not using Vim, I could reproduce some of this
    functionality using a program like [TextExpander][].

[^8]: I learned my lesson the hard way when I began taking my
    dissertation notes in a now-defunct program for PCs called Citation.
    When I switched from PC to Mac about six months into working on the
    thesis, I couldn't use Citation any more, and the only way to take
    my notes with me was to export them into one, gigantic Rich Text
    Format file that was impossible to sort in a reasonable way. Never
    again!
