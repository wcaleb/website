<div class="well">
In honor of the premiere of <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/abolitionists/">The Abolitionists</a></em> on PBS this week, I decided to publish a very old essay of mine on Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, two of the featured characters in the film. This essay originally appeared in 2004 on <a href="http://modeforcaleb.blogspot.com/2004/12/lives-of-douglass-part-i.html">my old blog</a>, where it appeared in two parts. For this version I have made some slight changes, added a few pointers to primary sources that have since been digitized, and fixed a few broken links.

Many Americans are familiar with the *[Narrative of the Life of Frederick
Douglass][]*, published in 1845; it is certainly the most famous personal
narrative of slavery ever written. (In 2002, the City of Baltimore
sponsored a city-wide reading of the *Narrative*, which the mayor
lauded as an "example of perseverance and determination.") But fewer
readers are aware that Douglass wrote another autobiography in 1855,
entitled *[My Bondage and My Freedom][]*. Probably even fewer are aware
that a third autobiography was published in 1881, *[The Life and Times of
Frederick Douglass][]*.

The most notable feature of the second autobiography is that by 1855,
Douglass had more "bio" to "graph." Seventeen years had passed since his
escape from slavery in Maryland, and ten years separated him from the
book that made him a celebrity. In that decade, he had established
himself as a lecturer on the antislavery circuit, toured Great Britain
to much acclaim, received funds from British friends to purchase his
freedom, and founded his own newspaper in upstate New York. *My Bondage
and My Freedom* covers these new events as well as most of the same
episodes that were in the *Narrative*. But these episodes in Douglass's
life as an enslaved Marylander are almost always embellished with
greater detail in his second book. More detail was partly a retort to
skeptics who doubted the authenticity of the *Narrative*. But the richer
detail of the second book is even more important as an example of
Douglass's incisive and innovative thinking about the problem of
slavery.

The *Narrative* had a mostly propagandistic function: it was intended as
an exposé of slavery's brutality. My Bondage more directly exposed
Douglass's inner experience in slavery. And it illuminated the
connections between that experience and his thought. The narrative
logic of the first book assumed that readers would infer antislavery
conclusions from the episodes it related. The second book complicated
and multiplied the possible conclusions that a reader could reach. For
one thing, it corrected what some readers might have perceived in the
*Narrative* as an antislavery argument based primarily on the poor
treatment of particular slaves. *My Bondage and My Freedom* made more
explicit what the *Narrative* had implied: that it was not just cruel
treatment, but the idea of slavery itself that repulsed Douglass and
provoked his desire to escape.

In the second book, for example, when discussing the kindness of Mrs.  Auld,
a Baltimore mistress who helped teach him how to read until rebuffed by her
husband, Douglass emphasizes that the slave-master relationship corrupted
whatever kind feelings existed between him and Auld. (Compare [this][] and
[this][1].) Her treatment of Douglass was incidental to the problem of slavery.
"Nature had made us *friends*," he wrote in *My Bondage*, "slavery made us
*enemies*. ... It was *slavery*---not its mere *incidents*---that I hated.
I had been cheated. ... The feeding and clothing me well, could not atone for
taking my liberty from me." In the first place, then, *My Bondage and My Freedom*
contains subtle but significant differences in Douglass's recounting of his
experience in "bondage." This book was not a litany of "mere incidents"---it
was a meditation on "slavery" and why Douglass hated it.

The second autobiography also extends the story of Douglass's "bondage"
into the story of his "freedom." Douglass's life as an abolitionist
after 1845 goes a long way towards explaining why he felt a second book
was needed by 1855. Today, *My Bondage and My Freedom* interests
antislavery historians mainly for what it tells us about Douglass's
conflicted relationship with radical white abolitionists like William
Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips.

Garrison and his allies---usually known as the Garrisonians---played a
crucial role in launching Douglass's career as a professional
abolitionist. Conversely, Douglass's fame as a speaker and moral
authority as a fugitive lent credibility to the Garrisonians as
antislavery leaders. As Douglass recounted in both the *Narrative* and *My
Bondage and My Freedom*, he was introduced to the world of Northern
antislavery in the late summer of 1841, while living in New Bedford,
Massachusetts and working as a day laborer. In August, at an
abolitionist meeting in Nantucket, Douglass delivered a rousing speech
that greatly impressed Garrison. Soon afterwards, Douglass was hired by
the Garrisonian American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS) as a lecturer, and
it was this association that also helped bring the *Narrative* into print.

Both Garrison and Phillips wrote introductory letters to the 1845
edition, vouching for its author's credibility as well as associating
themselves with this powerful new voice. And when the *Narrative*
attracted attention and seemed likely to endanger Douglass, the
Garrisonians' contacts with British abolitionists gave Douglass an
entrée into the United Kingdom, where he toured throughout 1846
addressing large audiences. But it was during this trip abroad that
Douglass's relationship with the Garrisonians began to fray around the
edges, a strain that worsened in 1847 after Douglass returned home, now
a legally free man who was intent on becoming his own editor.

The reasons for strain between Douglass and the Garrisonians were both personal
and ideological. On a personal level, Douglass sensed a patronizing tone among
many of his patrons, a mistrust of him that in many cases bordered on or
crossed over into a malicious bigotry. While touring in Britain, for instance,
Douglass learned that Maria Weston Chapman, a leading Boston Garrisonian, had
corresponded with some of Garrison's friends in Ireland and warned them to keep
an eye on Douglass's management of his money. Incensed by this and other
letters, [Douglass wrote an anguished reply to
Chapman](http://archive.org/details/lettertomrsmwcha00doug) that foreshadowed
his eventual break with the AASS.

But those personal conflicts cannot be separated from the ideological
disagreements that increasingly divided Douglass from the
Garrisonians---disagreements about the wisdom of "buying" slaves in order to
free them, for instance, or about the position of the Constitution on the issue
of slavery. At any rate, by the early 1850s, both faultlines---the personal as
well as the principled---had opened into a complete fracture, with both
parties sniping at each other and crying foul. Douglass repudiated the
Garrisonians; the Garrisonians likewise repudiated Douglass. These new
circumstances, in Douglass's mind, called for a new autobiography, and *My
Bondage and My Freedom* was the result.

Many scholars rightly blame this fracture partly on the persistence of racial
prejudice among white Garrisonians, which explains why some of them
(like Chapman) treated Douglass with a condescending paternalism. Many
Garrisonians failed to see past "Douglass the Fugitive" to Frederick
Douglass himself. For example, in *My Bondage and My Freedom*, Douglass
recalled that at the Nantucket meeting, Garrison followed Douglass's
speech with one of his own, "taking me as his text." This was a
revealing aside. In the early years of their acquaintance, white
Garrisonians often referred to Douglass as if he were mainly a Walking
Counterexample, a living rebuttal to the argument that black people were
degraded by nature. His life was first and foremost a "text" to
which they could turn for proof that former slaves could "rise," just as
the *Narrative* was a text they could use to prove the cruelty of Southern
bondage.

This was a strategy whose intention was to combat Northern racial prejudice
rather than to condone it. But it was understandable when Douglass lost
patience with constantly being gestured *at*, rather than being freed to
gesture in whatever direction he chose. Moreover, in driving the point home
that Douglass had risen from degradation to dignity, the Garrisonians often
lingered a little too long on the degradation and not as long on the dignity.
In early 1842, while introducing Douglass to [an antislavery meeting at Faneuil
Hall](http://archive.org/details/annualreport10mass) in Boston, Garrison said,
"It is recorded in holy writ, that a beast once spoke. A greater miracle is
here to-night. A chattel becomes a man."

Such analogies---which seem to suggest that Douglass's transformation from
slave into orator was as miraculous as Balaam's donkey learning to speak---are
rightly galling to our ears. But it is possible to exaggerate the extent to
which they were galling then, even to some black abolitionists. In his early
years as an abolitionist, Douglass also used himself as an example of the
extraordinary transformation from chattel-hood to manhood that only freedom
could effect. In *My Bondage and My Freedom*, he excerpted [a letter that he
wrote to Garrison](http://www.yale.edu/glc/archive/1091.htm) shortly after he
set foot on British soil, where legal proscriptions and social discrimination
against free blacks were less pronounced than in the Northern states. "I
breathe," Douglass exulted, "and lo! the chattel becomes a man."

Douglass and many other black abolitionists used such masculine language
to imagine the passage from slavery to freedom as a passage from
childishness and ignorance into manliness and respectability. Statements
like theirs and Garrison's were rhetorically strategic: they confronted
the terrible fact that Southern slaves *were* legally bought and sold as
if they were beasts of burden. In antebellum newspapers, advertisements
announcing rewards for the return of fugitive slaves were routinely
printed directly adjacent to advertisements that announced rewards for
the return of runaway horses. Given such pervasive visual iconography,
it was radically subversive to suggest that Douglass had been changed
from a "chattel" to a "man."

In short, Douglass's breach with the Garrisonians had less to do than
one might think with the fact that they viewed black abolitionists as
respectable and black slaves as degraded. Douglass himself held the same
view. Rather, what bothered Douglass was the way that Garrisonians
expected Douglass to play the role of the degraded slave, to straddle
the chasm they both saw between bondage and freedom. For example, white
Garrisonians often advised Douglass not to be *quite* so eloquent,
fearing that Douglass's excellence on the platform would give ammunition
to skeptics who doubted that he had ever been a slave. And since they
viewed Douglass's life as a propagandistic "text," they encouraged him
to stick to the story. In *My Bondage and My Freedom*, Douglass singled
out this kind of advice as insulting, constraining, and above all,
boring:

> During the first three or four months, my speeches were almost
> exclusively made up of narrations of my own personal experience as a
> slave. 'Let us have the facts,' said the people. So also said Friend
> George Foster, who always wished to pin me down to my simple
> narrative. 'Give us the facts,' said Collins, 'we will take care of
> the philosophy.' Just here arose some embarrassment. It was impossible
> for me to repeat the same old story month after month, and to keep up
> my interest in it. It was new to the people, it is true, but it was an
> old story to me; and to go through with it night after nights, was a
> task altogether too mechanical for my nature. 'Tell your story,
> Frederick,' would whisper my then revered friend, William Lloyd
> Garrison, as I stepped upon the platform. I could not always obey, for
> I was now reading and thinking. New views of the subject were
> presented to my mind. It did not entirely satisfy me to *narrate*
> wrongs; I felt like *denouncing* them.

That last line can be read as a thinly veiled critique of the Narrative
itself and an apologia for its sequel. It was also an indictment of the
Garrisonians' attempts to direct his life story in the way they saw fit.
There certainly were elements of racial prejudice in some of these
efforts to "pin" Douglass to his *Narrative*. But there is still much
ambiguity on this point. Since many freed people took new surnames as
signs of their independence---Douglass changed his from "Bailey" to
"Douglass"---we may be meant to see Garrison's whispering to him as
"Frederick" as an insult. Yet it might equally be seen as evidence of
the real intimacy and friendship that existed between Garrison and
Douglass prior to their parting of the ways.

Racial prejudice, at least, was the interpretation offered by James
McCune Smith, the black abolitionist and medical doctor who wrote the
preface to *My Bondage and My Freedom*, assuming the role that Garrison
and Phillips had claimed in the *Narrative*. Such gentlemen, Smith said,

> although proud of Frederick Douglass, failed to fathom, and bring out
> to the light of day, the highest qualities of his mind; the force of
> their own education stood in their own way: they did not delve into
> the mind of a colored man for capacities which the pride of race led
> them to believe to be restricted to their own Saxon blood. Bitter and
> vindictive sarcasm, irresistible mimicry, and a pathetic narrative of
> his own experiences of slavery, were the intellectual manifestations
> which they encouraged him to exhibit on the platform or in the lecture
> desk.

It is also accurate to say, however, that Douglass's growing dissatisfaction
with the white Garrisonians had as much to do with his pride in respectability
as it did with their "pride of race." As Douglass read and thought, he
understood himself to be moving farther and farther away from his former life
on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  The white abolitionists' advice to adopt the
persona of Frederick Bailey seemed like an attempt to deprive him of what he
understood as "freedom"---the freedom not to act in what he perceived to be
a "slavish" way. In short, although race was at issue in the breach between
Douglass and the Garrisonians, so was respectability: Douglass did not disagree
that "freedom" meant the education and uplift of black Americans. He too
believed, with them, that escaping slavery meant elevating oneself from
a degraded state. What he disliked was the way they encouraged him to mimic
that former state.

Personal conflict with white Garrisonians, then, was one seed of which
the fruit was Douglass's second book. The roots of that personal
conflict were entangled with weeds of racial prejudice that sprung up
even in the soil of radical white abolitionism. But there were other
seeds of discontent sown between Douglass and his former friends, and
their eventual rift also had to do with severe doctrinal disagreements.

---

Garrison and Douglass each needed the other for their joint movement to grow.
As James McCune Smith put it in the introduction to Douglass's second
autobiography, "It is not too much to say, that he formed a complement which
[the Garrisonians] needed, and they were a complement equally necessary to his
'make-up.'"

Yet by the time *My Bondage and My Freedom* was published in 1855, both
complements and compliments had given way to open conflict between Douglass and
the Garrisonians. As we have seen, part of the blame belongs to the persistence
of racial prejudice among some white Garrisonians---a condescension of which
Douglass became acutely aware while he toured Great Britain in 1846. Yet
prejudice alone does not explain the rift between Douglass and his former
friends.

Nor should we patronize Douglass with the condescension of posterity
by assuming that he was but a passive victim, who played no active role in the
rift. As McCune Smith also suggested in his foreword to *My Bondage and My
Freedom*, one of Douglass's own personality traits may have been an extreme
sensitivity to any hint of patronization---a trait that certainly would have
been understandable in a man with his history and in his circumstances. "The
same strong self-hood," wrote Smith, "which led him to measure strength with
Mr. Covey," (the slave driver immortalized by [the famous fight scene][] in
Douglass' *Narrative*) "and to wrench himself from the embrace of the
Garrisonians, and which has borne him through many resistances to the personal
indignities offered him as a colored man, sometimes becomes
a hyper-sensitiveness to such assaults as men of his mark will meet with, on
paper."

It may be impossible, however, to judge finally whether Garrisonians'
insensitivity or Douglass's sensitiveness was most to blame for the
complex personal friction between the two parties. What *is* clear is
that the friction only encouraged Douglass's desire for independence.
And however justified or understandable that desire might have been, it
is also clear that Douglass framed his break with the Garrisonians in
the most provocative of ways by publishing *My Bondage and My Freedom*.
The title itself was edgy. It claimed Douglass's narrative, his life, as
his own property: "*My* Bondage and *My* Freedom." In the introduction,
Smith's implicit comparison between Covey and the Garrisonians also
suggested that Douglass's "Freedom" from *Southern* "Bondage" would not
be the book's only plot. The book would also conclude by framing
Douglass's relationship with the Garrisonians as itself a kind of
"Bondage," and his decision to found his own newspaper in Rochester as a
new birth of "Freedom."

Sparks flew in the closing chapter of the book, when Douglass recounted
the objections that many Garrisonians had to his newspaper. These
objections were interpreted by Douglass as accusations that he was
"ambitious and presumptuous." Such words certainly had not been unknown
in Garrisonian circles when the subject of Douglass's new venture came
up. Although he tried hard to convince his former allies that he knew
what he was doing, Douglass wrote that he was "not sure that I was not
under the influence of something like a slavish adoration of my Boston
friends." Douglass knew that the Bostonians would be pricked by the word
"slavish," no matter how carefully it was swaddled in awkward syntax
(the double negative that began the sentence) and qualifications
("something like" ... "adoration" ... "friends"). The inflammatory word
was "slavish." And in the years after 1855, Douglass fanned the flame.
In [an 1857 speech](http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=4398), he declared:

> I know, my friends, that in some quarters the efforts of colored
> people meet with very little encouragement. We may fight, but we must
> fight like the Sepoys of India, under white officers. This class of
> Abolitionists don't like colored celebrations, they don't like colored
> conventions, they don't like colored Anti-Slavery fairs for the
> support of colored newspapers. They don't like any demonstrations
> whatever in which colored men take a leading part. They talk of the
> proud Anglo-Saxon blood, as flippantly as those who profess to believe
> in the natural inferiority of races. Your humble speaker has been
> branded as an ingrate, because he has ventured to stand up on his own
> right, and to plead our common cause as a colored man, rather than as
> a Garrisonian. I hold it to be no part of gratitude to allow our white
> friends to do all the work, while we merely hold their coats.
> Opposition of the sort now referred to, is partisan opposition, and we
> need not mind it.

Comparing Garrisonians to the colonial officers of the British empire?  These
were strong words indeed, especially when one considers that they were uttered
in the year of the "[Sepoy Mutiny][]" in India. But Douglass's 1857 speech also
brings us to a second important dimension of the Garrisonian rift, for it
suggests that the break had to do not only with personal offense, but also with
"partisan opposition." Douglass's break occurred at the same time that the
antislavery movement as a whole was fracturing, and not just along faultlines
dividing white and black reformers.

In the 1840s, many white abolitionists, like Gerrit Smith, James Birney,
and Lewis Tappan, increasingly disagreed with the Garrisonians about
major strategic and dogmatic issues, like the question of whether
violence could be used in the service of antislavery goals. Many black
abolitionists also broke with Garrisonians on precisely this issue.
Another major disagreement revolved around the Garrisonians' opposition
to forming political parties to run antislavery candidates for local and
national offices. Some Garrisonians opposed politics because they were
near-anarchists who believed that all human governments were sinfully
coercive. A larger number opposed antislavery parties because they
believed the Constitution itself was a proslavery document, a "covenant
with death" as Garrison put it. Any political action within the existing
framework---even voting, according to some---was corrupted before it
began. Beginning in 1842, Garrison and many of his supporters carried
this logic to its fullest extreme by calling for "disunion" between the
North and the South.

In 1854, a year before *My Bondage and My Freedom* was published,
Garrison dramatized the radicalism of these positions by publicly
burning a copy of the Constitution at a Fourth of July picnic for
abolitionists. Long before that act, however, Douglass had already
dissociated himself from such incendiary views. Against the
Garrisonians, he agreed with Gerrit Smith and others that the
Constitution was not necessarily proslavery, but had only been made so
by misinterpretation. He believed that political action was not only
justified on behalf of abolition, but positively required if it could be
effective. In *My Bondage*, Douglass spelled out his change of opinion
on these subjects. Even after he had moved to Rochester to start his new
paper, Douglass continued to be "on the anti-slavery question, a
faithful disciple of William Lloyd Garrison, and fully committed to his
doctrine touching the pro-slavery character of the United States, and
the *non-voting principle.*" But in 1851, following the passage of an
even more stringent Fugitive Slave Law by Congress, Douglass "became
convinced that there was no necessity for dissolving" the Union, and
"that to abstain from voting, was to refuse to exercise a legitimate and
powerful means for abolishing slavery." Douglass also concluded that the
Constitution, far from being a pact with the devil, as Garrison called
it, was "an anti-slavery instrument."

These conclusions placed Douglass firmly on the side of the Garrisonians'
opponents within the antislavery movement, and they reopened the wounds of
earlier schisms. Douglass's close friendship with McCune Smith and Gerrit Smith
and his complicated relationship with John Brown (see [this book][]) made the
wound wider. By 1853, [Garrison wrote to his
friend](http://books.google.com/books?id=v5aZrAuKt0wC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256),
Samuel J. May, that "with Douglass, the die seems to be cast. I lament the
schism, but it is unavoidable." It was made unavoidable partly by Douglass's
commitment to positions on which Garrison could admit no compromise. And as the
years wore on, the wounds only festered. By 1860 Garrison wrote in another
letter to May that Douglass's plans to be at an upcoming meeting "powerfully
repel me from attending. I regard him as thoroughly base and selfish, and
I know that his hostility to the American Anti-Slavery Society and its leading
advocates is unmitigated and unceasing. ... In fact, he reveals himself more
and more to me as destitute of every principle of honor, ungrateful to the last
degree, and malevolent in spirit. He is not worthy of respect, confidence, or
countenance."

Garrison is notorious for his unflinching positions, and his tendency to
impute false motives to anyone who disagreed with him. In that sense, he
was an equal opportunity offender. His public reproaches of white
enemies within the movement could be as harsh as those that he uttered
privately against Douglass in 1860. So what should we make of such hard
words?

We might turn again to what Douglass made of them in the
concluding pages of *My Bondage and My Freedom.*

> Here was a radical change in my opinions, and in the action logically
> resulting from that change. To those with whom I had been in agreement
> and in sympathy, I was now in opposition. What they held to be a great
> and important truth, I now looked upon as a dangerous error. A very
> painful, and yet a very natural, thing now happened. Those who could
> not see any honest reasons for changing their views, as I had done,
> could not easily see any such reasons for my change, and the common
> punishment of apostates was mine.

Douglass's statement might seem to settle the issue, except that it ultimately
opens up the same questions with which we began about how to explain the rift
between Douglass and the Garrisonians? Were the causes as simple as racism
among white abolitionists? Or did Garrisonians prove that they thought of
Douglass as equal to their white opponents by dignifying him with "the *common*
punishment" that they meted to all "apostates"? The question remains
a fascinating one, even today, precisely because it is difficult to
answer.^[For further reading, I recommend Benjamin Quarles's still valuable
1938 article on "The Breach between Douglass and Garrison," published in *The
Journal of Negro History* and available on
