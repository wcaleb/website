% The Dangers of a Fake Tubman Quote

In 2008, at the height of the presidential primary contest between Barack Obama
and Hillary Clinton, the feminist writer Robin Morgan wrote an [opinion column]
criticizing women who failed to support Clinton. To support her case, she
turned to an unlikely source: the abolitionist icon Harriet Tubman. Morgan
wrote:

The trouble with the quote was that Tubman never said it, as historians
rushed to point out. Tubman expert [Milton Sernett called it a
twentieth-century fabrication], and Tubman biographer [Kate Clifford
Larson listed it as a fake quote][larson] on her page of "Myths and Facts" about
Tubman.

Despite these corrections by scholars, however, the quote continues to
haunt the Internet. It shows up in a prominent sidebar when you [search
for the abolitionist's name] on Google, which only knows to report what
is most popular on webpages. It appears regularly on [Twitter]. It has
been circulated recently by prominent figures like [Senator Cory Booker]
and *New York Times* columnist [Charles M. Blow].

In recent years, however, I've noticed that supporters of the modern
anti-trafficking movement are major sources of the fake quote's popularity
online, particularly activists who are concerned about sex trafficking. As of
March 22, 2016, the [Love146 website] listed it prominently on its page about
reporting trafficking. (**Update:** Love146 removed the quote shortly after the
publication of this post.) The [Araminta Freedom Initiative], which focuses on
child sex trafficking and takes its name from Tubman, also features the fake
quote on its site. So does [The Justice Project] on a sidebar to its page about
forced prostitution. [Another group] provides the fake quote with the
additional hashtag "\#educationiskey." Other examples are [plentiful].

In one sense, these findings are not surprising. The Internet is a fake
quote emporium; just ask [Thomas Jefferson]. Moreover, Harriet Tubman's
story has from the beginning been a malleable icon who has been made to
say what various groups wanted her to say.

As [Jean Humez] shows in her book, *Harriet Tubman: The Life and the Life
Stories*, this began with the very first abolitionists, who were responsible
both for recording the illiterate Tubman's own narratives and for crafting the
first biographies. Those biographies are invaluable points of access into
Tubman's life and thought. But, Tubman scholars now agree, they also contained
a variety of embellishments that served abolitionists' purposes. Over time
[some of those embellishments][larson] (like the idea that Tubman took 19 trips
back to the South and freed 300 people) became settled facts in collective
memory, enshrined in children's books and other scholarly texts as Tubman's
actual story receded from view.

In other words, a fake quote attributed to Tubman is nothing new. It's
more of the same where the public discourse around Tubman is concerned.

Yet as a historian of slavery and abolition, I have always found this
*particular* fake quote to be particularly insidious. The idea it
expresses even seems perilously close to proslavery ideology as it
existed in the early American republic. In his book, [*In the Name of
the Father*], Francois Furstenberg shows that many paternalist masters
in the founding generation rationalized their slaveholding with the idea
of "tacit consent." Having just overthrown a government to which they
did not consent, American patriots told themselves that if enslaved
people did not rise up and resist, they must consent tacitly to their
enslavement.

Modern historians know the truth: enslaved people resisted their
condition in countless ways, large and small. If they were not able to
attain freedom, it was not because they didn't want it or because (as
the fake Tubman quote would have it) they "did not know they were
slaves." It was because powerful forces were arrayed against them. The
idea of "tacit consent" distracted attention from that fact.

I worry that the fake Tubman quote could have the same "red herring"
effect in conversations about modern trafficking. It encourages
activists who quote and read it to believe that the only thing standing
between modern slaves and freedom is knowledge, self-awareness,
education, and a willingness to actively dissent. But the corollary
comes uncomfortably close to the paternalistic idea that those who
somehow "choose" not to be freed or don't "know" they are slaves must
tacitly consent to their own exploitation.

It is pleasant to think that the only obstacle abolitionists face is
"false consciousness" on the part of trafficked persons. Unfortunately,
that idea may encourage true believers in the quote to underrate the
power and complexity of the forces arrayed against them today.

For over 150 years, Tubman's own, actual words have faced an uphill
battle to be heard over the noise of other people's words about her.
This is partly because of archival gaps and silences that make it
difficult to [listen to the enslaved] in the past. But historians of
American abolitionism know that even well-intentioned abolitionists
sometimes played a role in silencing the voices of those they were
trying to rescue.

To be sure, abolitionists made heroic, valuable efforts to surface the
stories of enslaved Americans and place them before the public. As [I've
argued before], historians would know far less than we do about enslaved
people's experience were it not for the antislavery movement. But
formerly enslaved abolitionists like Frederick Douglass sometimes [felt
pressure to say only the things that white abolitionists wanted
audiences to hear]. The fake quote that some have put in the mouth of
Harriet Tubman risks taking that ventriloquism a step further, while at
the same time casting an immediate doubt on whatever someone considered
a slave might actually say.

After all, assuming from the beginning that someone doesn't even know
she is a slave does not prepare us to hear what that person really
knows.

All of this would be an academic point if abolitionism and slavery
really were things of the distant past. But if, as modern abolitionists
declare, enslaved people remain in our world, then it is imperative for
us to listen---actually listen---to their own stories and testimonies,
even or *especially* when the people presumed to be unfree are saying
something different than we expect. Sometimes, as HAS Board Member
[Laura Murphy] has shown, *listening* will call our attention to horrors
that desperately need solutions, just as the first stories Harriet
Tubman told called abolitionists to arms. At other times, *listening*
will challenge our assumptions and redirect our efforts in new
directions or even force us to reconsider our approach.

Either way, historians against slavery should be the first to urge
fellow activists to listen to what the marginalized and unfree say that
they know, instead of rushing to assume things about what they *don't*
know. And, for the same reason, historians should also be vigilant in
correcting misrepresentations of past abolitionists in the present. We
need to ensure that we listen to what abolitionists like Harriet Tubman
*actually* said and call out fake quotes that say more about us than
them.
