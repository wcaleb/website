----

Recently the *Washington Post* reported on the ongoing excavation of [a
nineteenth-century African American settlement called
Timbuctoo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080205217.html)
in New Jersey. This long-buried community, now evident only in the
traces of found Mason jars, crumbling bricks, and the memories of the
community’s living descendants, was founded in the 1820s “by freed
blacks and escaped slaves” who bought the land from Quaker
abolitionists.

The story of this Timbuctoo was news to me. But it immediately caught my
eye because of my past study of the abolitionist John Brown, whose
famous antislavery raid on Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, had its
sesquicentennial anniversary last year. Brown’s raid is widely known as
one of the events that contributed to the coming of the Civil War. Less
widely known is that ten years before Harper’s Ferry, in 1849, Brown
moved his family to upstate New York to live near a small free black
settlement in [Essex County, near Lake
Placid](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=essex%20county%20new%20york).

And coincidentally, this settlement in North Elba, New York, which is
[also apparently under
excavation](http://pressrepublican.com/0100_news/x1896362004/Sifting-for-evidence-of-life-at-Timbucto),
was also sometimes referred to as Timbucto.

When reading the *Post* article I was first struck with the obvious
question: how coincidental was the fact that these two free black
communities in New Jersey and New York shared their unusual name? Is it
possible that Brown knew of Timbuctoo, New Jersey, when he moved to New
York in 1849? Or did abolitionists between the 1820s and the 1850s
simply refer often enough to
[Timbuktu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu)–the difficult-to-reach
city located in the West African interior–to make that name a familiar
and meaningful one to both Brown and the New Jersey settlers?

Those questions raise another big question: why the name Timbuctoo? As
[the *Post*
article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/02/AR2010080205217.html)
notes, the New Jersey settlement “was probably named after Timbuktu, the
town in Mali near the Niger River, although researchers are still trying
to find out how and why it got its name.” I can sympathize with these
researchers’ difficulty, because while doing research for a scholarly
article on John Brown, I briefly spent time trying to figure out “how
and why” Brown’s “Timbucto” got its name. Answering those questions was
not as easy as I thought it would be. In this post, I’ll talk about the
question of *how* Brown’s Timbucto got its name, and in Part II, I’ll
consider the question of *why* it bore that name.

Three years before John Brown moved his family to upstate New York, the
wealthy white abolitionist Gerrit Smith divided 120,000 acres of his
land there into small parcels and donated small deeds to free black New
Yorkers. Much of the land was deep in the Adirondack Mountains and
difficult to locate, much less to farm. Dishonest surveyors led some of
the deed-holders to land that wasn’t theirs, while some settlers
mistakenly squatted on land belonging to someone else.

In fact, upon his arrival in Essex County in 1849, one of the first
things John Brown did, having worked as a surveyor before, was to write
to Smith on behalf of three black settlers–James H. Henderson, and two
brothers, Thomas and Samuel Jefferson–who had settled and built
improvements on Lot 93 in Township 12. Henderson and the Jeffersons
probably settled on Lot 93 because the lands they had been deeded by
Smith were in a virtually inaccessible wilderness. But Lot 93 actually
belonged to a man named Pliny Nash, who had a lease-to-buy contract with
Smith. Nash allowed Henderson and the Jeffersons to live on the land,
and Henderson significantly improved his acres, clearing land and
building a house. But he and the Jeffersons were concerned about their
claims. Apparently before Brown arrived, one Jefferson paid money to
Nash, and on June 20, Brown wrote to Smith that he would help “some of
our colored friends” buy out Nash’s claim. He forwarded a draft for $225
to transfer the deed to Henderson, Samuel Jefferson, himself, and his
son Jason Brown, who would divide the lot “among themselves.”

Despite the difficulties facing settlers like Henderson, black
abolitionists in New York (including Frederick Douglass, who at the time
edited a newspaper in Rochester, and Willis A. Hodges, the co-editor of
another black newspaper in New York City) praised the Smith donation.
Between 1847 and 1849, New York’s African American press buzzed with
advice to settlers and lists of emigrants. Many, including Hodges,
believed settlers on the “Smith lands” could escape the immorality and
danger of the city and become self-sufficient. Hodges moved to a
Franklin County settlement in 1848; others, like Henderson and the
Jeffersons, moved near the Essex County villages of North Elba and West
Keene.

John Brown appears to have first called the Essex County settlement
“Timbucto” in 1848, when he began corresponding with Hodges about the
Smith lands. Six letters from Brown to Hodges, all written in 1848 and
1849 before Brown’s family arrived in Essex, were later published in the
New York *Evening-Post* shortly after Brown’s execution. ([Download a
PDF image of these
letters](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~wcm1/pdf/john-brown-to-hodges-letters-1848-1849.pdf),
taken from the *Evening-Post*.) Three of them refer to a settlement in
Essex County as “Timbucto.”

Because of those references, [many writers now use the name
“Timbucto”](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22john%20brown%22%20timbucto#hl=en&q=%22john%20brown%22%20timbucto&nfpr=1&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbo=u&tbs=bks:1&source=og&sa=N&tab=wp&fp=1&cad=b)
to refer to the entire African American settlement around North Elba,
where at least some members of Brown’s family remained more than a
decade later and where Brown’s body was buried after his execution. In
the earliest drafts of my article on Brown, I also used “Timbucto” and
“North Elba” interchangeably, following this common usage.

But along the way, several discoveries made me reconsider that naming
decision, and I started wondering how “Timbucto” got its name in the
first place. First, the name “Timbucto” was used disproportionately by
Brown himself and by members of his family. The *Evening Post* article
that published the letters to Hodges even claimed explicitly that Brown
himself named the settlement, though it did not reveal the source of
this information beyond the letters themselves. There is very limited
evidence that black settlers also used or played a role in choosing the
name. One letter by James H. Henderson, which was published in the
*North Star*, Frederick Douglass’s newspaper, on February 16, 1849, was
addressed from “West Keene Timbucto, Essex Co.” But this is the only hit
returned from a search for “Timbucto” in [a digitized edition of the
*North Star* made by Accessible
Archives](http://www.accessible.com/accessible/about/aboutAA.jsp). And
since Henderson reported in the letter, dated January 29, that Brown had
recently visited Essex and met Henderson, it is still possible that
Brown, who had used the name “Timbucto” in an earlier 1848 letter to
Hodges, was the one who dubbed the settlement. Aside from references to
“Timbucto” in the correspondence of Brown and his family, of which there
were several more, Henderson’s is the only clear example I know of in
which an African American settler used the name.

Second, even among the Browns, references to “Timbucto” appear to have
been confined to the first year or two after they moved to Essex County.
The late Edwin Cotter, the long-time curator of the Brown farmstead and
[state historic
site](http://nysparks.state.ny.us/historic-sites/29/details.aspx) at
North Elba, noticed this while conducting his researches on the area.
[Cotter’s papers](http://web.plattsburgh.edu/files/3/files/Cotter.pdf)
(PDF) are now available to researchers at [the library of
SUNY-Plattsburgh](http://www.plattsburgh.edu/library/specialcollections/manuscriptguides.php),
and when I visited this archive, I found a typed note by Cotter in which
he compiled a list of what he believed to be the only references to
“Timbucto or Timbuctoo.” These included the three letters to Hodges,
Henderson’s letter in the *North Star*, and a letter from Brown’s oldest
son John Brown Jr. to his mother Mary Brown in October 1849. I know of
at least one other reference to “Timbucto” in the Brown family
correspondence, but it–like the others–occurred before 1850. This
supports Cotter’s hypothesis that after 1849 or 1850 “the name is never
used again.”

Because of the limited usage of the name “Timbucto” in contemporary
sources, Cotter also wondered whether “Timbucto” might have been meant
to refer not to the whole Essex County settlement of which Brown was a
part, but instead to one small part of it. “If the whole town was called
Timbuctoo,” asked Cotter in his notes, “why was the name only used up to
the fall of 1849?” His notes continue:

> Why did the Browns not use it later to describe the town or the whole
> area? There were blacks here later but nobody we know of ever used the
> word Timbuctoo. Why? The only answer must be is that there was a small
> place or area the Browns and the blacks called Timbucto. The blacks in
> the place called Timbuctoo must have left here early, maybe as early
> as late 1849 or 1850 because the name is never used again.

The evidence I’ve seen supports this hypothesis, too, because on the
occasions when the Brown family referred to Timbucto, they implied that
it was a separate place from the location where they initially resided–a
rented farm in West Keene. Most of the letters that the Browns wrote
from or to their new home in 1849 and 1850 were addressed “Essex” or
“Keene,” and never “Timbucto,” unlike Henderson’s letter in the *North
Star*.

Not until March 1850 does “North Elba” even appear in the datelines of
the Browns’ letters that I have examined, which may be because North
Elba was officially considered part of Keene until 1850. But what seems
clear is that when the Browns referred to “Timbucto,” they were not
referring to where they themselves lived–the rented farm in West Keene.
Instead, when John Brown Jr. visited his siblings at the farmstead in
the fall of 1849, while both his parents were absent, he wrote to Mary
Brown that after reaching “Keene” and visiting the family he had also
visited “Timbuctoo,” suggesting it was a separate place. An earlier
letter from Ruth, Brown’s daughter, to her absent mother also reported
that “the folks are all very well to [or tow?] Timbucto, I believe,”
before mentioning several African American settlers specifically. This
suggests that there were several families living between the place Ruth
called Timbucto and the Browns’ own farm.

If “Timbucto” was not a name used by the Browns for the entire
settlement of Smith grantees or the area that included their rented
farm, then where was “Timbucto”? One plausible answer is that “Timbucto”
referred narrowly to the farms of Henderson and the Jefferson brothers
clustered together on Lot 93. The Cotter collection at SUNY-Plattsburgh
also includes some typed notes from 1994 by [local historian Mary
MacKenzie](http://www.wagner.edu/media/node/262), who gives some
compelling reasons for this theory. And though she doesn’t mention it in
her notes, the idea that “Timbucto” was a name for the
Henderson-Jefferson conclave would help explain why Henderson addressed
his letter to the *North Star* from “Timbucto” while no other black
settler that I know of used the name.

If “Timbucto” never did refer to the entire settlement of African
Americans in Essex County, as Cotter and MacKenzie both suspected, then
that raises the question of how the name lived on. As MacKenzie points
out in her notes at SUNY-Plattsburgh, the name got a new lease on life
from [the chapter on Brown and North Elba in Alfred L. Donaldson’s
two-volume *History of the
Adirondacks*](http://books.google.com/books?id=ohCrJZGEgYwC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false),
published in 1921. According to MacKenzie, Donaldson relied on the
memories of white “old-timers” still living in the area, and [his
resulting depiction of the black
settlement](http://books.google.com/books?id=ohCrJZGEgYwC&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false)
as a laughable shantytown amounted to a flagrantly racist caricature.
Donaldson mocked Gerrit Smith’s plan to found a “negro colony in the
mountains” as a “pure chimera,” suggesting that the likelihood of “an
escaped slave” creating a “so-called Adirondack farm” was about the same
as the likelihood that “an Italian lizard” would survive on a “Norwegian
iceberg.” And he didn’t stop there:

> The farms allotted to the negroes consisted of forty acres each, but
> the natural gregariousness of the race tended to defeat the purpose of
> these individual holdings. The darkies began to build their shanties
> in one place, instead of on their separate grants. Before long about
> ten families had huddled their houses together down by the brook, not
> far from where the White Church now stands. The shanties were square,
> crudely built of logs, with flat roofs, out of which little
> stove-pipes protruded at varying angles. The last touch of pure
> negroism was a large but dilapidated red flag that floated above the
> settlement, bearing the half-humorous, half-pathetic legend
> ‘Timbuctoo’–a name that was applied to the whole vicinity for several
> years.

The reliability of Donaldson’s reportage here is undercut by his clear
contempt for “the darkies.” He provides no source for his claim that the
name Timbuctoo “was applied to the whole vicinity for several years,”
and the passive construction of that sentence is a telling indication of
the mystery surrounding who actually began calling it that. Donaldson
also added the odd detail of a red flag reading “Timbuctoo” raised above
the settlement. That detail has been picked up by [some later
writers](http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&tbo=1&q=%28timbucto+or+timbuctoo%29+%22red+flag%22+%22north+elba%22&btnG=Search+Books#hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks%3A1&q=%28timbucto+OR+timbuctoo%29+%22red+flag%22+%22north+elba%22&aq=f&aqi=m1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=11e4dbcf7bece324)
and makes [an appearance in Russell Banks’s fictionalized historical
novel](http://books.google.com/books?id=gri4AX2RVSEC&&pg=PA175#v=onepage&q&f=false)
about John Brown. But until Donaldson mentioned it, the flag does not
appear in any earlier source that I know of.

MacKenzie apparently believed that Donaldson simply invented the flag in
order to underline the bathos and “negroism” of the whole experiment. It
is possible, though, that there was at some point a flag remembered by
local residents with whom Donaldson spoke. If there was a flag, however,
it doesn’t shed much light on how the name came to be attached to the
area. Was it a “half-humorous, half-pathetic” name jokingly used by
hostile white neighbors, and then repurposed by defiant black settlers
who made the name their own? Or was it used by Brown and/or Henderson to
refer to the Lot 93 farms, only to then be picked up in the neighborhood
and immortalized by a flag put up to mark the spot by unknown
parties–perhaps even long after the settlers had left? The Donaldson
account does not permit us to say, so that the questions of how
“Timbucto” got its name–or who named it–remain somewhat mysterious.

One thing the Donaldson paragraph may unintentionally do, however, is
strengthen MacKenzie’s idea that “Timbucto” referred to the small
cluster of Henderson and Jefferson farms on Pliny Nash’s land. That may
be why Donaldson’s sources gave him information suggesting that some
black settlers “began to build their shanties in one place, instead of
on their separate grants.” “After all,” as MacKenzie puts it in her
notes at SUNY-Plattsburgh, at one point there was “a total of 16 black
people living on the land—8 Hendersons and 8 Jeffersons. All three
houses were possibly close to Pine Brook, a handy source of water,”
which may explain Donaldson’s location of “Timbuctoo” near a brook.

Of course, the circumstantial evidence that “Timbucto” was actually a
name for the cluster of Henderson-Jefferson households does not help
answer the question of “how” that name was assigned. But it might help
solve the riddle Cotter identified–which is the question of why the name
“Timbucto” disappears from the primary sources almost as soon as it
appears. If the name was not used by Brown or other settlers after
around 1850, as I suspect, then it may be because both Henderson and the
Jeffersons did not stay in the area very long.

Remember that shortly after arriving in North Elba, Brown wrote to Smith
attempting to purchase the deed for the Timbucto farms on Lot 93 for
$225 so as to divide it between himself, his son, Henderson, and the
Jeffersons. But not long after that, Brown wrote to Smith again asking
him instead to credit the $225 to his own purchase of Lot 95. Henderson
apparently continued paying Nash for his claim on Lot 93, but both
Jefferson brothers soon left the area for several years, not returning
until 1854.

Henderson remained but, on October 15, 1850, he wrote a frustrated
letter to Smith. Smith’s agent had told Henderson that he could not
purchase acreage in Lot 93, though Brown had apparently suggested
otherwise. Now, evidently having heard rumors that the Jeffersons were
trying to sell their lots and fearing his would be sold from under him,
Henderson appealed to Smith: “i wood [sic] not like to loos [sic] my
house and improvements.”

Tragically, however, Henderson had not secured his title before he froze
to death in the woods in 1852. Shortly thereafter, Henderson’s wife left
“Timbucto” and placed his children in the Colored Orphan Aslyum in New
York City. Other African American settlers remained on the Smith lands
around North Elba, but with both the Hendersons and the Jeffersons now
gone from Lot 93, perhaps “Timbucto” was no more.
