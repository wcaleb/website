This post was originally published on my old blog as [In Search of John
Brown’s Timbucto, Part II][].
</div>

In [Part I][], inspired by a *Washington Post* [article][] about
archaeologists who are uncovering an early nineteenth-century African
American town in Timbuctoo, N.J., I set out to discover how another
black community in upstate New York got the name “Timbucto.”

As I explained in that post, being certain about who named the New York
“Timbucto” (which is most famous for its association with the famous
abolitionist John Brown, who once lived there or near there) is not easy
and may be impossible. The extant evidence suggests that Brown and his
family members first used the name “Timbucto” in the late 1840s to refer
to a small cluster of farms near North Elba that was settled by the
families of three free black men. But even if we could settle the
question of who named “Timbucto” (or Timbuctoo, N. J., for that matter)
it would not settle the related question of *why* that name was chosen.

That’s the question for this post: **Why would the name “Timbuctoo” be
attached to these early nineteenth-century African American communities,
one founded in the 1820s and the other at the end of the 1840s?**

Surely in both cases the name referred to the African city of Timbuctoo
or Timbuktu. But that means that to answer the question of “why
Timbuctoo” we need to know what Americans between 1820 and 1850 would
have known or thought they knew about the African city. What
associations would the African Timbuktu have had in the minds of those
who named these towns, whoever they were? To answer that question, we
would need to paint a picture of the place of the African Timbuktu in
the broader landscape of antebellum American culture. We’ll need to
explore the print culture, newspapers and books from which people in New
Jersey or people like John Brown would have learned about the African
city.

A full picture of how Timbuktu was represented in American culture would
require a larger research project than I can undertake for this post,
though it seems like a do-able project that would be of great interest.
It is possible, though, to sketch a preliminary portrait of Americans’
likely impressions of Timbuktu in the decades bounded by the founding of
Timbuctoo, New Jersey, and John Brown’s move to the Adirondack
mountains. It’s a portrait that includes not just John Brown, but an
early Pan-Africanist named John Brown Russwurm, a French explorer named
René Caillié, and a famous African Muslim prince who was enslaved,
brought to America, and then freed in 1828 after he had been recognized
by a white man who had met his father in Africa.

But unfortunately (or interestingly, depending on how you look at it)
this fascinating portrait still does not decisively settle the question
of why these two Timbuctoo communities got their name.

One thing is clear: the African Timbuktu had attracted great interest
from Europeans in the decades just before the period we’re interested
in. Late eighteenth-century European explorers and geographers were
greatly interested, first for scientific reasons but soon for imperial
and political ones, in discovering its precise location. There was no
record of a European visiting the city before the nineteenth century,
but based on reports it was thought to lie near the Niger River and at
the intersection of trade routes between the west and east coasts of the
continent, making it of geographical and commercial interest. The
mystery was enhanced by legends and rumors that described the city as
one of great wealth and beauty, further whetting the appetite of
eighteenth-century explorers.

In a recent celebrated book on Romanticism and eighteenth-century
science, [Richard Holmes discusses the mystique that thus surrounded
Timbuktu][] in Europe by 1800:

This “mythical” Timbuktu of golden palaces and untold wealth contributed
to public interest in several late eighteenth-century and early
nineteenth-century attempts by Europeans to reach the legendary city,
including the most famous attempts by Scottish explorer Mungo Park. But
Park famously failed to reach the city, and he was never heard from
again after his party was reportedly attacked on his second attempt, in
1805 and 1806, to explore the extent of the Niger River.

An African American sailor, Robert Adams, claimed to have been to the
city about five years after Park disappeared. But his narrative was
widely discredited, and meanwhile, the published stories that swirled
around Park’s disappearance also meant that the legends of Timbuktu’s
wealth were increasingly combined with stories about the dangers for
non-Africans (and particularly non-Muslims) trying to reaching the city.
This was especially true after the publication of reports that A. G.
Laing, another Scotsman, had reached the city in 1826, only to be
murdered before he could return to announce his success. [Alfred
Tennyson’s prize-winning 1829 poem][] “Timbuctoo” played on both ideas
(the brilliant beauty and allure of the city, as well as the danger and
difficulty of reaching it) by comparing it to other mythical or
“mystick” cities like Atlantis and El Dorado.

But in 1828, a Frenchman named René Caillié finally reached the fabled
city and lived to tell the tale, publishing a two-volume book, [*Travels
through Central Africa to Timbuctoo*][], about his journey. Though some
also cast doubt on Caillié’s account, it won him a fair amount of fame
on both sides of the Atlantic. And [the account of how he did it][]
certainly satisfied readers who probably already assumed, thanks to
stories about Mungo Park, that the trek would be perilous.

Indeed, Caillié explained that to reach the city without being enslaved
or killed, he had to disguise himself as a Muslim, confine himself in a
house for much of his brief stay in the city, and take his notes
furtively. But Caillié also punctured any Romantic expectations about
Timbuktu that still floated in the European or American imagination,
dismissing the “exaggerated notions” that had long prevailed about “this
mysterious city, which has been an object of curiosity for so many
ages.” In fact, Caillié sheepishly confessed that upon reaching the
city, [he was sorely disappointed][the account of how he did it].

> How many grateful thanksgivings did I pour forth for the protection
> which God had vouchsafed to me, amidst obstacles and dangers which
> appeared insurmountable. This duty being ended, I looked around and
> found that the sight before me, did not answer my expectations. I had

> colour.

The only golden nuggets here, in other words, were grains of yellow
sand.

So … where does all of this get us in our search for an answer to why
the New Jersey and New York settlements, founded respectively in the
1820s and the 1840s, took their name from Timbuktu? Well, the various
reports of journeys to Timbuktu from Park to Caillié certainly mean that
around the time of these settlements’ founding, there was a discourse
surrounding the African city and, as [a quick Google Books search][]
reveals, there was a fair number of published mentions of the place on
both sides of the Atlantic between 1800 and 1850.

But what “Timbuctoo” *signified* to readers in these years is more
ambiguous. To sum up what we’ve seen so far, there were several things
that the name “Timbuctoo” might have conjured up for someone in early
nineteenth-century America, especially by 1830:

-   the site of a great, riverine African civilization of surpassing
    wealth and beauty
-   an extraordinarily remote, dangerous and difficult-to-reach place
-   a disappointingly “ill-looking” and decidedly non-wealthy place
    surrounded by desert
-   a Muslim city, hostile to outsiders, where all the “native
    inhabitants” were, as Caillié wrote, “zealous Mahometans”

The question, then, is this: Which of these ideas was intended by the
people who named the “Timbuctoo” settlements in New Jersey and New York?

Of course, what this quick survey reveals is that it would be hard to
answer this question decisively without knowing for sure *how* these
places got their names and who did the naming. What if, for example,
these African American settlements were actually named by white
neighbors who were hostile to the settlements?

That possibility is not ruled out by anything in the *Post* article
about New Jersey and is still conceivable in the case of the North Elba
community. But in that case, the name could have been intended as an
epithet used by whites to belittle a community of black outsiders.
Worse, the name could have been a joke intended to suggest the
incongruity between what must have been the great hopes of the free
black inhabitants and their actual living conditions. As I reported in
Part I, twentieth-century Adirondack historian Alfred L. Donaldson
viewed the “Timbuctoo” name for John Brown’s North Elba community as a
“half-humorous, half-pathetic legend,” and the brief history I’ve
sketched in this post makes it plausible to imagine hostile whites using
the name in the same way a century before Donaldson wrote. A
[contemporary magazine article][] provides at least one such example of
a racist, parodic essay from the period that pokes fun at Timbuctoo.

**Abolitionists and Timbuktu**

On the other hand, what if, as seems most likely in the case of John
Brown’s Timbucto, these settlements got their names from African
Americans themselves or from white abolitionist sympathizers? In that
case, the question of “why Timbuctoo” yields a quite different set of
likely answers.

To antislavery groups, the name would have been most attractive because
of the original legends surrounding Timbuktu as a city of great wealth
and civilization. In fact, in the few years before Caillié reached the
African city, abolitionist and antislavery writers still took for
granted the largely positive legends surrounding Timbuktu and used them
to advance different kinds of antislavery arguments.

For example, in an 1824 article in the *North American Review*, a writer
sympathetic to the aims of [The American Colonization Society][], which
advocated the removal of free black men and women from the United States
to western Africa, mentioned “Timbuctoo” in order to support the
colonizationists’ argument. This writer described Timbuctoo as a
civilized place where African youths were sent from great distances “to
be instructed in Arabic learning” and to study the Koran. The
tendentious conclusion this colonizationist drew was both that Africa
needed the Christian missionaries that free black Americans could
supply, and also that “the natives of Africa are in some degree sensible
of their ignorance, and willing to be made wiser.”

Despite the backhanded compliment in such lines, here was a vision of
Timbuctoo starkly different from those of racist parodists. And even
farther from parody was an article that appeared in the Baltimore-based
antislavery newspaper the *Genius of Universal Emancipation* in 1826.
The *Genius* used reports about the wealth of interior African cities to
argue that the degradation of Africans often cited by proslavery
apologists had only occurred in those places where European slave
trading had ravaged the continent. Citing Timbuctoo in particular, the
*Genius* contended that “in those parts [of Africa] never prophaned by
the unhallowed foot of a slave dealer–civilization advances and the arts
of social life [flourish]–the natives cultivate the cotton and indigo.”

References to “Timbuctoo” in antislavery literature also spiked slightly
in 1828 thanks to the publicity that year surrounding [Abd al-Rahman][]
(or Abduhl Rahahman, in contemporary sources), who became widely known
to Americans in that year because of his improbable, but apparently
likely, story. Born the son of a Fulbe chief in Africa, Abd al-Rahman
spent 40 years as an American slave before he was recognized in Natchez,
Mississippi, by a white man whose life had been saved in Africa by Abd
al-Rahman’s father. When Henry Clay, an ardent colonizationist,
discovered his story, he and the Society campaigned for the emancipation
of the “Prince of Timbo” so he could return to Africa, and the
Colonization Society sponsored a celebrated lecturing tour in the North.
In Washington, the Prince met with President John Quincy Adams, who
recorded the encounter in his diary on May 15, 1828 ([click for a page
image of the diary][]). As he toured Northern cities, Abd al-Rahman also
attracted crowds who were fascinated by his ability to write Arabic
script. (He often wrote out souvenir cards with what curiosity-seekers
thought was the Lord’s Prayer in Arabic; it turns out that, unbeknownst
to his admirers, he was writing bits of the Koran.)

Though Abd al-Rahman was from “Timbo,” several sources I’ve seen changed
this to “Timbuctoo,” perhaps conflating the two places in ignorance. It
is difficult to reconstruct Abd Al-Rahman’s own reports about his life
because his broken English was usually transcribed by people like his
colonizationist sponsors who had either a loose or tendentious
understanding of African geography. (Some writers also claimed he was
from Morocco.) But Abd al-Rahman appears to have reported that he had
been educated in Timbuctoo, which some might have confused with his
homeplace. (President Adams’s diary entry said that Abd al-Rahman named
“Tombuctoo” as his “home.”) At any rate, for abolitionists and
colonizationists already inclined to imagine Timbuctoo as the seat of a
great interior Africa kingdom and a site of Arabic and Islamic learning,
Abd al-Rahman was a perfect illustration.

But Abd al-Rahman captured the interest of African American
abolitionists in particular, especially the early pan-Africanist and
black emigrationist [John Brown Russwurm][]. Russwurm had mentioned the
“far-famed city of Timbuctoo” in an 1827 essay published in the New York
City *Freedom’s Journal*, the first African American newspaper in the
United States. And in Russwurm’s pioneering article, “The Mutability of
Human Affairs,” Timbuctoo appears as part of a larger, mournful argument
about how the great ancient civilizations of Africa have been forgotten.
(You can download a full, PDF issue of *Freedom’s Journal* in which
Russwurm’s essay appeared [here][], thanks to the [Wisconsin Historical
Society’s archive][] of the paper.) In 1828 the *Journal* reported with
great interest on Abd al-Rahman’s Northern tour; in one issue ([PDF][])
Russwurm reprinted an article from the New York *Journal of Commerce*
reporting on the presence of the “native Prince of Timbuctoo,”
continuing that “Abduhl Rahahman” had been confirming the glowing
reports of the African city’s commercial wealth and opportunities.
Russwurm also met Abd al-Rahman himself in Washington, and he mentioned
the encounter in a *Freedom’s Journal* article on August 29, 1828
([PDF][1]). Russwurm reported that Timbuctoo was one of several cities
of great size in the African interior and praised Abd Al-Rahman’s
extensive learning:

> It must be evident to every one that the Prince is a man superior to
> the generality of Africans whom we behold in this country. His
> education is also superior; and when we take into consideration his
> Alma Mater, our astonishment becomes greater. He is a fine Arabic

> has ever been the current belief that Timbuctoo was the only city of
> size in the interior; but the Prince assures us that there are two
> others nearly as large near the banks of the Niger.

Such articles are clear examples of the ways that antislavery writers by
the 1820s could fold limited information about Timbuktu into their
arguments against slavery. Though I don’t currently plan to undertake
the additional research, I have a hunch that additional digging would
reveal other instances like these of abolitionists using the positive
stories surrounding Timbuktu. (It would also be interesting to find out
if there was abolitionist discourse surrounding the claims of the
African American sailor who earlier said he had been there.) This brief
tradition of discourse about the city explains why African American
abolitionists and writers also appear to have been quite interested by
the journeys of Laing and Caillié to the city. The *Freedom’s Journal*,
for example, noticed the reports about Laing and Caillié in several
issues in late 1828 and 1829 (especially on [December 26, 1828][]; as
well as on March 28, 1829; and August 10, 1829).

**Inconclusive Conclusions**

These context clues combine to make it clearer why “Timbuctoo” might
have occurred to African Americans as a name for their community in New
Jersey (founded, apparently, in the decade of Caillié and Abd
al-Rahman), and also why John Brown might have applied the name to the
cluster of farms settled by James H. Henderson and the Jefferson
brothers in New York.

*But* this brief sketch of “Timbuctoo” in antebellum American culture
still does not allow us to say definitively why these settlements got
that name, because the name was still clearly multivalent. We cannot be
certain about the meanings it conveyed to the people who lived in the
New Jersey and New York communities. It certainly seems plausible that
it had a positive connotation to free black Americans like those who
inhabited the New Jersey town. But other, more subversive or ambivalent
meanings may have been intended.

For example, it’s noteworthy that one of the antislavery groups most
interested in Timbuktu was the Colonization Society, which ultimately
won legal emancipation for Abd Al-Rahman. Believing that Al-Rahman could
help introduce Christianity to Arabic-speaking Africans in his homeland,
the Society also helped pay for his journey back to Africa, where
Al-Rahman died in 1829 before reaching his long-lost homeland. By 1829,
most Northern free black communities back in the United States (with the
exception of a few black abolitionists like Russwurm) were mobilizing
against colonizationism and the Society, insisting that the United
States was their homeland and that they intended to stay put. It may be
telling that after 1830, references to the name Timbuctoo, while
relatively common in *Freedom’s Journal* did not appear other than once
or twice in other African American titles from the period included in
the [Accessible Archives database of antebellum free black
newspapers][]. So perhaps the selection of the name “Timbuctoo” for a
New Jersey town was meant to convey, in the colonizationist atmosphere
of the 1820s, a subtle but biting political message: home was *here*.

Ambiguity also clouds the apparently straightforward use of Timbuctoo by
abolitionists when we turn to John Brown’s New York settlement. This is
especially true when we recall that by 1849, thanks to Caille’s book,
more realistic reports about Timbuktu had begun to appear. If Brown was
the one who named Timbucto in New York, it seems most probable that he
meant in some way to reference the African civilization. But it is also
possible that for him, his family, or the settlers themselves, the name
connoted (as it sometimes does in vernacular slang today) a place that
was remote and difficult to reach. It might even have conveyed some of
the disjuncture that settlers experienced between their expectations
about the Adirondacks and the harsh farming and living conditions they
discovered there, especially in the winter.

John Brown himself always promoted the agricultural potential of the
Adirondacks, though he too commented on North Elba’s remoteness and
isolation and celebrated the construction of new bridges and roads to
make the area more accessible. But some of his sons were less optimistic
about the climate and fertility of the soil and questioned the grandiose
hopes that might have been implied in their father’s use of the name
“Timbucto.” For example, when John Brown Jr., Brown’s eldest son, first
visited the family farm near North Elba in 1849, he sent an ambiguous
report to his mother (who was then away):

> We reached Keene a week ago last Tuesday evening. Found all well.
> Although it rained most of the time while we were there, we visited
> most of the *important* places. Such as Timbuctoo &c.
>
> There are really without joking, many things to recommend that
> country. Among them may be reckoned the pure air and water, almost
> insuring good health and a total exemption from trouble by neighbors
> geese.

In addition to indicating, as I suggested in Part I, that the Browns
themselves did not live in the place they called “Timbuctoo,” Brown
Jr.’s letter leaves unclear whether he was “joking” about Timbuctoo’s
being an “important” place. Or maybe he was poking fun at the contrast
between the paradise implied by the name and the dismal weather while he
was there.

At any rate, after this first visit Brown Jr. seemed impressed by the
“country” his father had settled in. In subsequent years, however,
Brown’s other sons soured on the climate and geography and tried to
dissuade Brown Jr. when he and his wife briefly considered moving to
North Elba, around the time that James H. Henderson froze to death in
the woods. Jason Brown referred to the place sarcastically in 1853 as
“Father’s New Palestine,” lending further support to the idea that John
Brown had used the name “Timbucto” for its positive connotations, and
told his eldest brother that “North Elba would do tolerably well, for a
colony of Norwegians if they had none of them ever heard of a temperate
climate.” Owen Brown, another brother, was more direct in giving his
reasons why John Brown Jr. should not settle in the area:

> Dear Brother & Sister, Men are blessed with reason, for their guide,
> Then is it not the duty of every man, to exercise his reason to the
> full extent, & allow its requirements to be the guide of all his

Here was a picture of the area once called “Timbucto” that was more like
the disappointing discoveries that Caille had made when he reached
Timbuktu and found it a land of “no vegetation but stunted trees and
shrubs,” with soil “totally unfit for cultivation.” Owen’s reference to
the area as a “romantic region” again suggests that when his father used
the term Timbucto, he had the fabled, “mystick” city of Tennyson, Abd
al-Rahman, and Mungo Park in mind more than the dangerous, distant, arid
desert of Caille. But the fact that both connotations were available to
antebellum Americans who spoke of Timbuktu underlines the difficulty of
knowing *why* two early nineteenth-century African American communities
got the name “Timbuctoo” without being able to answer, first, *who*
named them and what their views about the communities were.

Which is to say, in sum, that I can only end this search for John
Brown’s “Timbucto” with more questions that need to be asked, more
directions to be explored, a few scraps of contemporary discourse about
Africa that might be used as maps, and a word of empathy for the
researchers who, according to the *Post* article that inspired these
posts, are still trying to figure out how and why Timbuctoo, New Jersey,
got its name.
